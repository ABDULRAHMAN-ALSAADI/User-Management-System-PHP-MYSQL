# 🧑‍💻 User Management System (PHP + MySQL)

This is a simple web project I made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL with XAMPP.
The project allows users to enter their name and age, then submit it. After submitting, the data will appear in a table.

## 🔧 Features
Add a user with a name and age.

Display users in a table.

Each user has a status button (Active/Inactive).

Status toggles between 0 = Inactive and 1 = Active.

## 🗃️ Database Info
Database name: user_management

Table: users

Fields:

id: INT, Primary Key, Auto Increment

name: VARCHAR(100)

age: INT

status: TINYINT (0 or 1) — 0 = Inactive, 1 = Active

## 💡 Tools I used
XAMPP for local server and MySQL

HTML, CSS, JS for the frontend

PHP for backend logic

MySQL for database
